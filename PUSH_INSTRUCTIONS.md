git clone https://github.com/pontush81/BRF-SaaS.git
cd BRF-SaaS

## Step 2: Copy the Documentation Files

Copy the documentation files we've created:

```bash
cp ~/README.md ~/ROADMAP.md ~/ARCHITECTURE.md ~/GITHUB_PROJECT.md ./
```

## Step 3: Commit and Push the Files

Add, commit, and push the files to your repository:

```bash
git add README.md ROADMAP.md ARCHITECTURE.md GITHUB_PROJECT.md
git commit -m "Add project documentation files"
git push origin main
```

1. Navigate to your repository: https://github.com/pontush81/BRF-SaaS
2. Click on the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Board" as the template
5. Name the project "BRF-SaaS Development"
